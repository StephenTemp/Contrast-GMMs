# Contrastive-GMMs for Open-World Learning
**Summary**: leverage Gaussian mixture models to clarify semi-supervised contrastive embeddings in open-set conditions.We present a light-weight, deep contrastive network which utilizes a Gaussian mixture model to identify class instances unseen at train time. Our model compares favorably with the state-of-the-art on __ModelNet40__, and we perform an ablation study to determine the impact of our newly-introduced Gaussian loss term on both the learned embeddings and model performance. Last, we discuss the potential left un-analyzed in our empirical work here, and provide direction for future work
